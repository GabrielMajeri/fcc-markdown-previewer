# Live Markdown Previewer

Real-time Markdown previewer built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). The interface is minimalistic (`<textarea>` next to an `<output>`) but works on both mobile and desktop.

Created as part of a [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/) [frontend project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

**Check out the live app [here](https://gabrielmajeri.ro/fcc-markdown-previewer/)!**
